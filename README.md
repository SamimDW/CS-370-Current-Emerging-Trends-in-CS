## Reflection

### Project Overview and My Contributions

For this project, I worked on building and training a pirate intelligent agent using reinforcement learning concepts. I was provided with starter code that defined the structure of the environment by the TreasureMaze class and the experience replay system by the GameExperience class. From there, I completed the qtrain function, which implements the training loop. This included resetting the maze, managing exploration and exploitation through the epsilon parameter, storing episodes in memory, and training the neural network using experience replay. I also worked on refining the stopping conditions, tracking win rates, and ensuring the agent improved over time by balancing exploration with learning from past states.

### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Looking at the broader field of computer science, I now better understand that computer scientists are problem-solvers who use abstraction, algorithms, and data to create solutions that matter in real-world contexts. In this project, reinforcement learning was not just an abstract concept. It was applied to train an agent to make decisions and adapt over time. This reflects the idea that computer scientists build tools, systems, and models that can learn, optimize, and ultimately serve human needs in complex environments.

### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist, I approach problems methodically. I break down large challenges into smaller components, study the underlying algorithms, and then iterate through testing and refining solutions. For example, when my agent was not improving, I reviewed the balance between exploration and exploitation, adjusted the memory size, and evaluated the network training process. This process of diagnosing, experimenting, and honing reflects the iterative mindset that computer science demands.

### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

This project highlighted my ethical responsibilities to end users and organizations. Intelligent systems can be powerful, but they must be designed responsibly. It is my responsibility to ensure that the algorithms I build are transparent, fair, and serve the intended purpose without unintended harm. Whether in reinforcement learning agents, neural networks, or any other domain, the end users' trust depends on ethical design choices. Reflecting on this project, I see how the concepts I learned about reinforcement learning, neural networks, and responsible implementation connect directly to my growth as a computer scientist and the values that guide the field.
